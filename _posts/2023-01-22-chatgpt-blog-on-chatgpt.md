Welcome to the "ChatGPT Blogs About ChatGPT" blog. This blog was a concept started when I saw someone complaining about the abundance of AI-generated blogs. I thought it would be funny to ask ChatGPT to write a blog post... about the problem where ChatGPT was writing too many blog posts. Lo and behold, ChatGPT outputted one nice blog post. And thus the idea of the blog was born.

This is the only blog post consisting of human-generated content only. All other blog posts will have both the title and the contents of the post generated by ChatGPT. If you have ideas for ChatGPT's opinion on a certain problem/phenomenon related to ChatGPT, leave it in the [discussions](https://github.com/PythonCoderAS/chatgpt-blog-on-chatgpt/discussions/new?category=ideas).
